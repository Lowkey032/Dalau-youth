                The universe stretched infinitely in all directions, a canvas of stars scattered across the void. 
                In the heart of a small galaxy, a planet thrived under the warm embrace of its sun. 
                It was here that our journey began, where curiosity led to the greatest discoveries of humankind...

                As the first explorers gazed at the sky, they wondered about the mysteries beyond their reach. 
                What lay beyond the twinkling stars? Were there other worlds like ours? 
                Questions fueled their dreams, and soon, they would embark on a journey beyond imagination.

    title: "Chapter 1: The Wonders of Space",
    author: "Usborne Books",
    content: `
        Space is vast and full of mysteries. For centuries, scientists have gazed at the stars, 
        trying to uncover the secrets of the universe. In this chapter, we explore some of the 
        most fascinating aspects of space, from black holes to distant galaxies.\n\n

        The universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old. It all began with the Big Bang, 
        an immense explosion that created all matter and energy. Over billions of years, galaxies, stars, 
        and planets formed, leading to the cosmic landscape we see today.\n\n

        One of the most intriguing objects in space is the black hole. A black hole is a region in space 
        where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Scientists believe black holes 
        are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity. Despite their darkness, they play 
        a crucial role in shaping galaxies.\n\n

        Another fascinating phenomenon is the existence of exoplanets—planets that orbit stars outside 
        our solar system. The search for exoplanets has revealed thousands of worlds, some of which may 
        have conditions suitable for life. Astronomers use telescopes and other tools to study these planets, 
        searching for signs of habitability.\n\n

        Space exploration has advanced significantly over the past few decades. Humans have landed on the Moon, 
        sent rovers to Mars, and launched telescopes that capture stunning images of distant galaxies. With new 
        missions planned, the future of space exploration holds endless possibilities.\n\n

        This chapter introduces you to the wonders of space and the incredible discoveries made so far. 
        As you continue reading, you’ll learn more about the forces that govern the cosmos and the role 
        our planet plays in this vast universe.\n\n

    title: "Chapter 1: The Power of Questions",
    author: "Randall Munroe",
    content: `
        What happens if you throw a baseball at the speed of light? What if the moon disappeared? 
        In this book, we tackle absurd yet fascinating scientific questions and try to find answers 
        using real physics and mathematics.\n\n

        Humans have always been curious creatures. We look up at the sky and wonder about the universe, 
        we drop objects to see how they fall, and we question how the world around us works. Science is 
        built on questions—sometimes ridiculous, sometimes profound, but always intriguing.\n\n

        Imagine standing on a baseball field, holding a ball. You wind up and throw it—but instead of 
        the usual speed, the baseball travels at nearly 300,000 kilometers per second, the speed of light. 
        What would happen? Would it simply zoom past the batter, or would something more extraordinary occur?\n\n

        According to physics, if a baseball moved at that speed, the energy it carries would be so immense 
        that it would behave more like an explosion than a ball. The molecules in the air wouldn’t have time 
        to move out of the way. Instead, they would be compressed, heating up rapidly and creating a shockwave 
        similar to a nuclear blast. The baseball itself would vaporize almost instantly, leaving nothing but 
        destruction in its wake.\n\n

        But why stop at baseballs? What if you shrank down to the size of an atom and tried to swim in a glass 
        of water? What if gravity suddenly reversed? These questions might sound silly, but they allow us to 
        explore the fundamental laws of physics in surprising ways.\n\n

        Throughout history, scientists and thinkers have pushed the boundaries of human understanding by 
        asking bold and unexpected questions. From Galileo questioning the movement of the planets to Einstein 
        pondering the nature of time, curiosity has been the driving force behind every major scientific discovery.\n\n

        In the following chapters, we’ll continue to take scientific principles to their extreme limits to 
        see what happens when reality meets imagination. By thinking outside the box and asking the "what ifs," 
        we open up new ways to understand the world—and the universe—around us.\n\n

    title: "Chapter 1: The Cosmos and You",
    author: "Neil deGrasse Tyson",
    content: `
        The universe has always fascinated humankind. From the ancient philosophers to modern-day scientists, 
        we've always looked up at the stars and wondered about our place in the cosmos. This chapter introduces 
        key concepts in astrophysics and how they shape our understanding of space.\n\n

        The night sky is filled with billions of stars, each telling a story of cosmic evolution. For millennia, 
        humans have observed these celestial bodies, using them for navigation, storytelling, and even predicting 
        the seasons. But it wasn’t until the invention of telescopes that we truly began to understand what lies 
        beyond our world.\n\n

        The cosmos operates on a vast scale. The distances between stars and galaxies are so immense that we measure 
        them in light-years—the distance light travels in a year, roughly 9.5 trillion kilometers. Our own galaxy, 
        the Milky Way, contains hundreds of billions of stars, and beyond it are countless other galaxies, each with 
        its own unique structure and history.\n\n

        Understanding the universe requires understanding the fundamental forces that govern it. Gravity, for instance, 
        shapes the movement of planets, stars, and galaxies. It keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun and is the reason 
        why objects fall to the ground. Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity revolutionized our understanding of 
        gravity, showing that massive objects actually warp the fabric of space-time itself.\n\n

        One of the most awe-inspiring concepts in astrophysics is the idea that we are made of "star stuff." The elements 
        that make up our bodies—carbon, oxygen, nitrogen—were forged in the cores of ancient stars. When these stars 
        reached the end of their lives, they exploded in spectacular supernovae, scattering their enriched elements 
        across the universe. Over time, these elements came together to form new stars, planets, and eventually, life itself.\n\n

        As we continue to explore the cosmos, we gain deeper insights into its mysteries. Are we alone in the universe? 
        What lies beyond the observable edge of space? These questions drive scientists to push the limits of technology, 
        sending telescopes and probes deeper into the unknown. With every discovery, we come closer to understanding our 
        cosmic origins and our place in the grand tapestry of existence.\n\n

        This chapter has only scratched the surface of what astrophysics has to offer. As we dive deeper into the 
        following chapters, we will explore the nature of time, the formation of galaxies, and the possibility of 
        extraterrestrial life. The universe is vast, and the more we learn, the more we realize how much remains 
        to be discovered.\n\n

    title: "Chapter 1: A Ball at Netherfield",
    author: "Jane Austen",
    content: `
        It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\n\n
        However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\n\n
        “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”\n\n
        Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n\n
        “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”\n\n
        Mr. Bennet made no answer.\n\n
        “Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.\n\n
        “You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\n\n
        This was invitation enough.\n\n
        “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; 
        that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris 
        immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”\n\n
        “What is his name?”\n\n
        “Bingley.”\n\n
        “Is he married or single?”\n\n
        “Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\n\n
        “How so? How can it affect them?”\n\n
        “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\n\n
        “Is that his design in settling here?”\n\n
        “Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.”\n\n
        “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are 
        as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.”\n\n
        “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has 
        five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\n\n
        “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\n\n
        “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.”\n\n
        “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\n\n
        “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, 
        merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new-comers. Indeed, you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, 
        if you do not.”\n\n
        “You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my 
        hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\n\n
        “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so 
        good-humored as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.”\n\n
        “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of 
        quickness than her sisters.”\n\n
        “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”\n\n
        “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration 
        these twenty years at least.”\n\n
        “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\n\n
        “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\n\n
        “It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.”\n\n
        “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.”\n\n
        Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humor, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been 
        insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little 
        information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters 
        married; its solace was visiting and news.

    title: "Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit Hole",
    author: "Lewis Carroll",
    content: `
        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do.\n\n
        Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.\n\n
        “And what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversation?”\n\n
        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), 
        whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, 
        when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\n
        There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 
        “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!”\n\n
        But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, 
        Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, 
        or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down 
        a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\n
        In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\n
        The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, 
        so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\n
        Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and 
        to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, 
        but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards 
        and bookshelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; 
        it was labeled “ORANGE MARMALADE,” but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing 
        somebody underneath, so she managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n\n
        “Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down-stairs! 
        How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!”\n\n
        Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. 
        “I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—”\n\n
        “Yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?”\n\n
        Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people 
        that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—”\n\n
        “Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, 
        I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.)\n\n
        “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! 
        There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. 
        But do cats eat bats, I wonder?”\n\n
        And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 
        “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?”\n\n
        She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n\n
        “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?”\n\n 
        when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\n
        Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,\n\n
        and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner,\n\n
        “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:\n\n
        she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\n\n
        There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, \n\n
         she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

    author: "Mary Shelley",
    content: `
        You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.\n\n
        I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.\n\n
        I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight.\n\n
        Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\n\n
        Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid.\n\n
        I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight.\n\n
        There, Margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.\n\n
        There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.\n\n
        Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.\n\n
        What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?\n\n
        I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever.\n\n
        I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.\n\n
        These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river.\n\n
        But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\n\n
        These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven.\n\n
        For nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.\n\n
        This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.\n\n
        I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole.\n\n
        You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas’s library.\n\n
        My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading.\n\n
        These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\n\n
        These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.\n\n
        I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation.\n\n
        I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.\n\n
        You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\n\n
        But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\n\n
        Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.\n\n
        I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise.\n\n
        I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.\n\n
        I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage.\n\n
        Twice I actually hired myself as an undermate in a Greenland whaler and acquitted myself to admiration.\n\n
        I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness.\n\n
        So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.\n\n
        Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated.\n\n
        Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were encompassed round by a very thick fog.\n\n
        We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.\n\n
        About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end.\n\n
        Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind was depressed; but I quickly rallied my spirits and cheered my comrades.\n\n
        We procured a few sledges, and we moved slowly over the frozen ocean with our loaded sledges.\n\n
        On a sudden, we perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.\n\n
        We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.\n\n
        This appearance excited our unqualified wonder.\n\n
        Who could be the person whom we beheld from our ship in this desolate world?\n\n
        We debated this question with some eagerness, when our attention was drawn to another event.\n\n
        We perceived that the savage man had disappeared beyond the horizon, and we continued our voyage northward.\n\n

    author: "H.G. Wells",
    content: `
        The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us.\n\n
        His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated.\n\n
        The fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses.\n\n
        Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision.\n\n
        And he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.\n\n
        'You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.'\n\n
        'Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?' said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.\n\n
        'I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you.\n\n
        You know, of course, that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence.\n\n
        They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.'\n\n
        'That is all right,' said the Psychologist.\n\n
        'Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.'\n\n
        'There I object,' said Filby. 'Of course a solid body may exist. All real things—'\n\n
        'So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?'\n\n
        'Don't follow you,' said Filby.\n\n
        'Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?'\n\n
        Filby became pensive. 'Clearly,' the Time Traveller proceeded, 'any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration.\n\n
        But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact.\n\n
        There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.\n\n
        There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.'\n\n
        'That,' said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp; 'that very clear indeed.'\n\n
        'Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,' continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.\n\n
        'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it.\n\n
        It is only another way of looking at Time.\n\n
        There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it.\n\n
        But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of the idea. You have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?' \n\n
        'I have not,' said the Provincial Mayor.\n\n
        'It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others.\n\n
        But some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly—why not another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry.\n\n
        Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago.\n\n
        You know how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the thing.\n\n
        See?' \n\n
        'I think so,' murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words.\n\n
        'Yes, I think I see it now,' he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\n\n
        'Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time.\n\n
        Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on.\n\n
        All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.'\n\n
        'Scientific people,' proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this, 'know very well that Time is only a kind of Space.\n\n
        Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer.\n\n
        Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward towards noon.\n\n
        So it is possible to create diagrams that represent our movement through Time, as we do through Space.\n\n
        We only see it differently because we are conscious of Time in a peculiar way, different from the other dimensions.'\n\n
        'And you are going to explain how we can travel through Time?' asked the Medical Man.\n\n
        'That is the precise thing I mean to explain,' replied the Time Traveller.\n\n
        And with that, he leaned forward, eager to unveil the wonders of his creation.\n

    content: `
        One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug.\n\n
        He lay on his armor-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow-like sections.\n\n
        From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place.\n\n
        His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.\n\n
        “What’s happened to me?” he thought.\n\n
        It was no dream. His room, a regular human bedroom, only a little on the small side, lay quietly between the four well-known walls.\n\n
        Above the table, on which an unpacked collection of sample cloth goods was spread out—Samsa was a traveling salesman—hung the picture which he had only recently cut out of an illustrated magazine\n\n
        and set in a nice, gilded frame. It was a picture of a woman with a fur hat and a fur boa.\n\n
        She sat erect there, lifting up in the direction of the viewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm had disappeared.\n\n
        Gregor’s glance then turned to the window. The dreary weather—the raindrops were falling audibly down on the metal window ledge—made him quite melancholy.\n\n
        “What about sleeping a little longer and forgetting all this nonsense,” he thought. But that was entirely impractical,\n\n
        for he was used to sleeping on his right side, and in his present state he couldn’t get himself into this position.\n\n
        No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he always rolled again onto his back.\n\n
        He must have tried it a hundred times, shutting his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the floundering legs,\n\n
        and gave up only when he began to feel a mild, dull pain he had never felt before.\n\n
        “O God,” he thought, “what a demanding job I’ve chosen! Day in, day out on the road.\n\n
        The stresses of business are far greater than those of going home to the boss.\n\n
        And then there’s the curse of all my traveling, the worries about train connections,\n\n
        the irregular bad food, temporary and constantly changing human relationships which never come from the heart.\n\n
        The devil take it all!” He felt a slight itching on the top of his abdomen.\n\n
        He slowly pushed himself on his back closer to the headboard so he could lift his head better.\n\n
        He found the itchy area, which was entirely covered with white dots the size of little pinheads.\n\n
        He tried to touch the place with one of his legs, but he retracted it immediately, for the contact made him shudder all over.\n\n
        He slid back again into his previous position.\n\n
        “This getting up early,” he thought, “makes a man quite idiotic.\n\n
        A man must have his sleep. Other traveling salesmen live like harem women.\n\n
        For instance, when I come back to the inn during the course of the morning to write up the necessary orders,\n\n
        these gentlemen are just sitting down to breakfast.\n\n
        If I were to try that with my boss, I’d be thrown out on the spot.\n\n
        Who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me.\n\n
        If I didn’t have to hold back for my parents’ sake, I’d have quit long ago.\n\n
        I would go to the boss and tell him just what I think—let him be as astonished as he wants.\n\n
        That would be a peculiar thing, too. Then he would fall off his desk!\n\n
        It’s also a strange way of sitting up there, talking down to the employee from the height of his desk.\n\n
        Anyway, I haven’t completely given up that hope.\n\n
        Once I’ve saved up the money to pay back what my parents owe him—that should take another five or six years—I’ll do it for sure.\n\n
        Then I’ll take my big cut and say goodbye.\n\n
        That will be the grand finale.\n\n
        But for the moment, I’d better get up, since my train leaves at five.”\n\n
        And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\n\n
        “Heavens,” he thought. It was half past six, and the hands were going quietly on.\n\n
        The alarm hadn’t gone off.\n\n
        “But that’s what happens when you sleep peacefully,” he thought.\n\n
        “Now it’s already half past six.\n\n
        The next train leaves at seven.\n\n
        To catch that, I’d have to hurry like a madman.\n\n
        The sample collection isn’t even packed up yet, and I don’t feel particularly fresh and lively.\n\n
        And even if I were to catch the train, there would be a big blow-up with the boss because the office assistant would have been waiting for the five o’clock train and would have long since reported my absence.\n\n
        The boss would certainly come round with the health insurance doctor and would reproach my parents for their lazy son and cut short all my objections by referring to the doctor.\n\n
        The doctor, incidentally, believes that all people are perfectly healthy but just don’t work hard enough.\n\n
        So he’d not be too far from the truth in this case.\n\n
        I’d even have to try to pull myself out of bed to show respect to the doctor.\n\n
        For him, the patients are totally healthy, but in their utter dislike of work make up illnesses for themselves.\n\n
        Well, at the moment, I have to get out of bed. My train leaves in an hour.\n\n
        Before this quarter past seven has passed, I absolutely must be up.\n\n
        And by then someone from work will surely have come around to inquire about me, since the office opens before seven.”\n

        Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
        and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.\n\n
        It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; 
        whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, 
        and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, 
        that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically 
        knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.\n\n
        This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
        I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, 
        some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n\n
        There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with 
        her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that noble mole is washed 
        by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n\n
        Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, 
        by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal 
        men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks 
        of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; 
        of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green 
        fields gone? What do they here?\n\n
        But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them 
        but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just 
        as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come 
        from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue 
        of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?\n\n
        Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you 
        down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged 
        in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water 
        there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen 
        to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as everyone knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.\n\n
        But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape 
        in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a 
        hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy 
        smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. 
        But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, 
        yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for 
        scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop of water 
        there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, 
        upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money 
        in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or 
        other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first 
        told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it 
        a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of 
        Narcissus, who, because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. 
        But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is 
        the key to it all.\n\n
        Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over 
        conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you 
        must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow 
        quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger; nor, 
        though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction 
        of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of 
        every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, 
        schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of 
        officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically 
        salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. 
        It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of 
        those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\n\n`

        3 May. Bistritz.—Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; 
        should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, 
        from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. 
        I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct 
        time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; 
        the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, 
        took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.\n\n
        We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night 
        at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, 
        which was very good but thirsty. (Mem., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was 
        called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along 
        the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I don’t know how I should 
        be able to get on without it.\n\n
        Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum and made search 
        among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge 
        of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. 
        I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, 
        Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least 
        known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle 
        Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey Maps; but I found 
        that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some 
        of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.\n\n
        In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with them 
        the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. 
        I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the 
        Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known 
        superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some 
        sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I must ask the Count all about them.)\n\n
        I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog 
        howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, 
        for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was 
        wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. 
        I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant 
        stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (Mem., get recipe for this also.) 
        I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, 
        for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. 
        It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?\n\n
        All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little 
        towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams 
        which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, 
        and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people, 
        sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw 
        coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque.\n\n
        The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. 
        They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips 
        of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them. 
        The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, 
        great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, 
        all studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long 
        black hair and heavy black mustaches. They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage 
        they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are, however, I am told, very harmless 
        and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.\n\n
        It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place. 
        Being practically on the frontier—for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina—it has had a very 
        stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, 
        which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent 
        a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.\n\n
        Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, 
        for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door 
        I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress—white undergarment with a long double apron, front, 
        and back, of colored stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said: “The Herr Englishman?”\n\n
        “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.”\n\n
        She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves, who had followed her to the door. 
        He went, but immediately returned with a letter:\n\n
        “My Friend.—Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting you. Sleep well to-night. 
        At three to-morrow the diligence will start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you 
        and will bring you to me. I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land. 
        —Your friend, Dracula.”`

    content: `
        To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. 
        In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin 
        to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, 
        but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world 
        has seen; but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, 
        save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s 
        motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted 
        temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a 
        sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion 
        in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and 
        questionable memory.\n\n
        I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the 
        home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient 
        to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our 
        lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the 
        drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of 
        crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up 
        those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his 
        doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson 
        brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning 
        family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, 
        I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n\n
        One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil 
        practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my 
        mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, 
        and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his 
        tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head 
        sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told 
        their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new 
        problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n\n
        His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly 
        eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. 
        Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n\n
        “Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\n\n
        “Seven!” I answered.\n\n
        “Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. 
        You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.”\n\n
        “Then, how do you know?”\n\n
        “I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most 
        clumsy and careless servant girl?”\n\n
        “My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. 
        It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I 
        can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, 
        I fail to see how you work it out.”\n\n
        He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n\n
        “It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight 
        strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very 
        carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction 
        that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London 
        slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of 
        silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his 
        stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\n\n
        I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. “When I hear you give your 
        reasons,” I remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, 
        though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe 
        that my eyes are as good as yours.”\n\n
        “Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. 
        The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.”\n\n
        “Frequently.”\n\n
        “How often?”\n\n
        “Well, some hundreds of times.”\n\n
        “Then how many are there?”\n\n
        “How many? I don’t know.”\n\n
        “Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, 
        because I have both seen and observed.”\n\n
        “By the way, since you are interested in these little problems,” said he, “perhaps you are ready to assist me in a new 
        one. It is a delicate matter, and there is a client waiting in the sitting-room.”\n\n
        And so began the curious case of “A Scandal in Bohemia.”`
